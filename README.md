## How to Use this Repo
This repo contains the relevant demo and workshop slides for a six session workshop series teaching fundamental working knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence I've developed for Bond Intelligence. The slides and code included should provide a strong introduction to the variety of topics under the broad umbrella of machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as provide resources for delving deeper.
